Challenge D: ID Assignment
Description
a) You work in a company with 100 people - to start, please create a list of people ranging from Person 1 to Person 100. For company purposes, each of these people is identified with a Personal ID, which is a combination of 2 uppercase letters and a random number of 5 digits. For each person, generate a random ID, and store it in a dictionary alongside their name (for example ('Person 5': 'AB73648')). Then sort the dictionary according to the values of their Personal IDs.

b) One month later, your company changes the ID format for every employee - from now on, every person will have an ID that consists of only letters. In order to convert them, every number in the employee ID should be replaced by the corresponding uppercase letter in the alphabeth. Please write a function that accomplishes this change and apply it to the dictionary.
